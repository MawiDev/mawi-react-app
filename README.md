mawi-react-app
I created this repository to have a clean project that is always ready to start new apps in react, with all my favorite tools that I use to develop. I would like to have all the necessary tools and an easy-to-use method already set up, in order to be more productive during the development of your apps.
Repository created to start a new react app manually without using tools like parcel or vitejs.
what will be installed will be:

-webpack stuff -react and react-dom -babel stuff -post css, css-loader etc.. -tailwindcss

Folder management is very simple, /public for index.html and /src for the react app.

-> Clone repository in your local machine, rename the folder and enter it. -> 'npm install' -> 'npm start' for start developing. -> your app will serve on http://localhost:3000.

Enjoy it!
